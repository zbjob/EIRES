# SIGMOD 2021 submission
EIRES: Efficient Integration of Remote Data in Event Stream Processing

## Code
Source code is in src. We build separate directories for synthetic data, bushfire detection and google cluster monitoring.
### Synthetic
Directories,  `EIRES_cost_cache` and `EIRES_LRU_cache` are EIRES codebase combine with cost-based cache and LRU cache respectively.
They have similar code structures. `main` functions are in defined in `EIRES_cost_cache/cep_match/cep_match.cpp` and `EIRES_LRU_cache/cep_match/cep_match.cpp`.
